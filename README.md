# Login_system
Login system using NodeJs, Mysql as database and hbs/bootstrap as an simple front end.

This project was something i wanted to learn as basic for nodejs and myskills on mysql database, i did all the querys on terminal (wsl arch linux on windows 11) so i could try this method by doing querys direct on mysql (mariadb on arch).

It took some weeks so i could try doing some front end things, but i got my way there with some help of my friends.
